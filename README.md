## Simple-fullstack-java-web
28/Feb/2021

What is a better way to jump-start a new year after the lunar new year festival than making a beautiful - responsive - full-stack java web appüöÄ.

I designed both the front-end (HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap 4), back-end (Java, SpringBoot, Spring JPA, Hibernate, Hibernate Validation, Lombok, Thymeleaf), and also the database (MySQL). Moreover, I used JUnit5 for unit testing to validate the user input; we never wanted the user inputting blank space and then cryüòÇ.

## Functions
The website contains four main functions on four pages:

- Function 1: Home page: Display introduction entry and all remained machinery items (name, short description, and description picture) sort by published date
        
- Function 2: Machine for sale: Display detail of all items
        
- Function 3: About our company: Display about us information
        
- Function 4: Contact: Help user to submit their request and validate user input
        
P/s: Not so big a project, but like many projects before, I can not hold the joy of a fully finished and deployable website running smoothlyüòç.


## Unit testing
Using com.theanh.fullstack.web.entity.ClientSubmissionTest to test the validation of user input.


## Environment
The program ran successfully on:
- JDK 11
- OS: Window 10
- Database: MySQL 8.0


## Setup
To run, you need to run the database script in db-script folder.
Then check the username and password in application.properties.
Then run the FullstackJavaWebApplication.java
