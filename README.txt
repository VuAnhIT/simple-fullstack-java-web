What is a better way to jump-start a new year after the lunar new year than making a beautiful - responsive - full-stack java web app🚀.
I designed both the front-end (HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap 4), back-end (Java, SpringBoot, Spring JPA, Hibernate, Hibernate Validation, Lombok, Thymeleaf), and also the database (MySQL). Moreover, I used Junit4 for unit testing to validate the user input; we never wanted the user inputting blank space, right 😂 ?
The website contains four main functions on four pages:
Function 1: Home page :
Display introduction entry and all remained Machinery items (name, short description, and Description picture) sort by published date
Function 2: Machine for sale
Display detail of all items
Function 3: About our company
Display about us information
Function 4: Contact
Help user to submit their request
Validating user input
P/s: Not so big a project, but like many projects before, I can not hold the joy of a fully finished and deployable website running smoothly😍.

The program ran successfully on:
JDK 11
OS: Window 10
Database: MySQL 8.0

To run, you need to run the database script in db-script folder.
Then check the username and password in application.properties.
Then run the FullstackJavaWebApplication.java
